## Flop MCP

One URL, one API key. If your AI tool supports MCP, it can inspect, search, and build inside your running Unreal Editor right now. Works with **Cursor, Claude Code, Windsurf, Cline, VS Code Copilot, OpenClaw**, and any other MCP client.

### Quick Setup (Remote MCP)

The fastest way to get Unreal Engine tools in your IDE is the hosted **Flop MCP** at [flopperam.com/mcp](https://flopperam.com/mcp). No local server, no Python install — just a URL and an API key.

1. **Get an API key** at [flopperam.com/account](https://flopperam.com/account)
2. **Install the Unreal plugin in your project** — see [flopperam.com/docs](https://flopperam.com/docs). Go to the Installation tab for instructions.
3. **Add the config to your IDE:**

**Cursor** — `.cursor/mcp.json` (project) or `~/.cursor/mcp.json` (global):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "flopperam-unreal": {
      "url": "https://agent.flopperam.com/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Claude Code** — run in your terminal:
```bash
claude mcp add -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" --transport http flopperam-unreal https://agent.flopperam.com/mcp
```

**Cline / Local LLMs** (Ollama, LM Studio, etc.):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "flopperam-unreal": {
      "type": "streamableHttp",
      "url": "https://agent.flopperam.com/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

That's it — verify the server shows as connected in your IDE and start prompting.

## The Flop Agent — [flopperam.com](https://flopperam.com/)

The Flop MCP gives your IDE data. **The Flop Agent** is a fully autonomous AI that lives inside Unreal Engine — it plans multi-step workflows, writes and executes code, recovers from errors, and iterates until the job is done.

- **Dynamic workflows** — decomposes complex requests into steps and adapts when something goes wrong
- **Unreal-native reasoning** — tuned prompts, specialized routing, deep knowledge of UE APIs and Blueprints
- **Full Blueprint creation and editing** — create new Blueprints, add variables/components/events/functions, update graph logic, compile and validate
- **World building** — creates materials, places actors, builds structures, and verifies as it goes
- **Code execution** — executes commands directly inside the editor — spawning actors, editing Blueprints, building levels
- **Multiple AI models** — routes to the best model per task (Opus for reasoning, Flash for lookups)
- **Chat inside Unreal** — embedded browser panel, no window switching
- **Text/image to 3D** — three quality tiers (Good, High Quality, Very High Quality)

Supports Unreal Engine 5.5, 5.6, and 5.7. Full docs at [flopperam.com/docs](https://flopperam.com/docs).

## Featured Capabilities

### Complete Blueprint Visual Scripting

**Program Blueprints entirely through AI** with comprehensive node creation, graph management, and variable systems.

```bash
# Create complex Blueprint logic with control flow, variables, and functions
> "Create a Blueprint with a health system that tracks damage and triggers a death event"
→ create_blueprint() + create_variable() + add_node() + connect_nodes()

# Support for 23+ node types across 6 categories:
# Control Flow: Branch, Comparison, Switch (Byte/Enum/Integer), ExecutionSequence
# Data: VariableGet, VariableSet, MakeArray
# Casting: DynamicCast, ClassDynamicCast, CastByteToEnum
# Utility: Print, CallFunction, Select, SpawnActor
# Specialized: Timeline, GetDataTableRow, AddComponentByClass, Self, Knot
# Animation: PlayAnimation, StopAnimation, Timeline nodes
```

**Advanced Blueprint Features:**
- **Function Management**: Create custom functions with inputs/outputs, rename, and delete
- **Variable System**: Full property control (public/private, replication, tooltips, ranges, units)
- **Node Properties**: Dynamic pin management, type modification, semantic editing
- **Graph Analysis**: Read complete Blueprint content, analyze execution flow, inspect variables
- **Connection System**: Wire nodes together with automatic type validation

### World Building & Architecture  
```bash
# Create massive futuristic cities with skyscrapers, flying cars, and advanced infrastructure
> "Build a massive futuristic city with towering skyscrapers"
→ create_town(town_size="massive", architectural_style="futuristic", building_density=0.95)

# Build complex multi-room houses with windows, doors, and roofs
> "Create a Victorian mansion complex with east and west wing houses."
→ construct_house(house_style="mansion", width=1500, height=900)
```

### Intelligent Mazes
```bash
# Generate solvable mazes with guaranteed paths using recursive backtracking
> "Make a 15x15 maze with high walls"
→ create_maze(rows=15, cols=15, wall_height=4, cell_size=250)
```

## Lightning-Fast Setup

### Prerequisites
- **Unreal Engine 5.5+** 
- **Python 3.12+**
- **MCP Client** (Claude Desktop, Cursor, or Windsurf)

### 1. Setup Options

**Option A: Use the Pre-Built Project (Recommended for Quick Start)**
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/flopperam/unreal-engine-mcp.git
cd unreal-engine-mcp

# Open the pre-configured project
# Double-click FlopperamUnrealMCP/FlopperamUnrealMCP.uproject
# or open it through Unreal Engine launcher

# The plugin is already installed and enabled!
```

**Option B: Add Plugin to Your Existing Project**
```bash
# Copy the plugin to your project
cp -r UnrealMCP/ YourProject/Plugins/

# Enable in Unreal Editor
Edit → Plugins → Search "UnrealMCP" → Enable → Restart Editor
```

**Option C: Install for All Projects**
```bash
# Copy to Engine plugins folder (available to all projects)
cp -r UnrealMCP/ "C:/Program Files/Epic Games/UE_5.5/Engine/Plugins/"

# Enable in any project through the Plugin Browser
Edit → Plugins → Search "UnrealMCP" → Enable
```

#### Extra steps for Mac
If you're on macOS and Unreal Engine fails to open the project due to compilation errors, you'll need to manually compile the C++ plugin first. To do so, follow these steps:

##### Step 1: Check Your Xcode Version

```bash
xcodebuild -version
xcrun --show-sdk-version
```

Note your Xcode version number (e.g., `26.0.1`, `16.0`, `15.2`, etc.). If your version is newer than 16.0, you'll need to patch the Unreal Engine SDK configuration.

##### Step 2: Patch Unreal Engine SDK Configuration

Edit the file at your Unreal Engine installation (replace `UE_5.X` with your version):

```bash
# Path to edit:
/Users/Shared/Epic Games/UE_5.X/Engine/Config/Apple/Apple_SDK.json
```

Update the following values:

**Change 1:** Update `MaxVersion` to support your Xcode version
```json
{
  "MaxVersion": "YOUR_XCODE_VERSION.9.0",  // e.g., "26.9.0" if you have Xcode 26.x
}
```
Replace `YOUR_XCODE_VERSION` with your major Xcode version from Step 1.

**Change 2:** Add LLVM version mapping for your Xcode version (add to the `AppleVersionToLLVMVersions` array)
```json
{
  "AppleVersionToLLVMVersions": [
    "14.0.0-14.0.0",
    "14.0.3-15.0.0",
    "15.0.0-16.0.0",
    "16.0.0-17.0.6",
    "16.3.0-19.1.4",
    "YOUR_XCODE_VERSION.0.0-19.1.4"  // e.g., "26.0.0-19.1.4" for Xcode 26.x
  ]
}
```
Replace `YOUR_XCODE_VERSION` with your major Xcode version from Step 1.

##### Step 3: Compile the Plugin

Run the Unreal Build Tool to compile the project:

```bash
"/Users/Shared/Epic Games/UE_5.X/Engine/Build/BatchFiles/Mac/Build.sh" \
  UnrealEditor Mac Development \
  -Project="/path/to/unreal-engine-mcp/FlopperamUnrealMCP/FlopperamUnrealMCP.uproject" \
  -WaitMutex
```

Replace:
- `UE_5.X` with your Unreal Engine version (e.g., `UE_5.5`)
- `/path/to/unreal-engine-mcp/` with the actual path to your cloned repository

##### Step 4: Open the Project

Once compilation succeeds, you can open `FlopperamUnrealMCP.uproject` in Unreal Engine.

### 2. Launch the MCP Server

```bash
cd Python
uv run unreal_mcp_server_advanced.py
```

### 3. Configure Your AI Client

Add this to your MCP configuration:

**Cursor**: `.cursor/mcp.json`
**Claude Desktop**: `~/.config/claude-desktop/mcp.json`
**Windsurf**: `~/.config/windsurf/mcp.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "unrealMCP": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "--directory",
        "/path/to/unreal-engine-mcp/Python",
        "run",
        "unreal_mcp_server_advanced.py"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Note that on Mac, and sometimes on Windows, you may have to replace the "uv" string passed as the value to "command" in the above `mcp.json` file with the exact absolute path to the uv executable. To get that path, run one of these commands:
- Mac: `which uv`
- Windows: `where uv`

> "Generate a town square with fountain and buildings"
> "Make a challenging maze for players to solve"
```
